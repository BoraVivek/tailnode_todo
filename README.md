# Tailnode Todo Assignment By Vivek Bora

## Functionality
- Add Tasks -> Enter Task on input box and hit enter to add a Task
- Mark a Task as Complete -> Click on a task to mark it as Completed
- Reset Tasks -> Click Reset Todos button to reset the state of application.


## Approach for Storing Tasks
Tasks are being stored in a state, and also getting stored in localstorage, so that on refres/reload, tasks get loaded from localstorage to maintain the state of application.

## Deployed URL
[https://tailnode-todo.web.app/](https://tailnode-todo.web.app/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
